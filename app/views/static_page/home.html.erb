			<li class="content_header"> A bit about myself </li>
			I'm nineteen and a proud Penn State student. My academic life is hard to describe, but my classes are more or less focused towards the social sciences and social entrepreneurship. In between my time outside of school, I like to work with a local org called New Leaf, a co-working slash collaboration hub that connects really unique people together. And of course, I like to social dance. Music is good too. Friends are better. Meditating is serene.
